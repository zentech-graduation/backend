/**
 * Generates deterministic, causally-ordered {@code created_at} timestamps for every seed writer.
 *
 * <p>Constructed once per seed run with a fixed RNG seed and a single {@code referenceNow} captured
 * at run start; every offset is derived from that one instant, never from {@code Instant.now()}, so
 * two runs against the same seed content produce identical relative timestamps - {@code
 * referenceNow} itself is real wall-clock time and varies run to run, so absolute timestamps are
 * not reproducible, only each generated instant's offset from that reference. Every method builds
 * its result by adding a strictly-positive (or strictly-bounded) random duration on top of the
 * invariant it must respect, so an ordering invariant (e.g. "a comment never precedes its post")
 * holds by construction and can never be violated by clamping a generated value after the fact.
