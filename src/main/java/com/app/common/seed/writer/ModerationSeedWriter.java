/**
 * Seeds {@code reports} (~180), {@code admin_actions}, {@code user_warnings} (27) and {@code
 * user_strikes} (14) - every {@code warn_user}/{@code issue_strike} action the source content
 * actually scripts; see this class's "Background reports" note below for why {@code reports} alone
 * is padded beyond its literal content) from {@code moderation_cases.json}'s 6 narrative cases plus
 * its standalone {@code supplementary_actions} and {@code supplementary_reports} arrays, applying
 * every action's side effect (post/comment/story/message removal or restore, warning/strike
 * issuance or revocation, suspension expiry) to the row it targets.
 *
 * <p><b>Timeline translation</b>: each case's {@code timeline} array carries real ISO-8601
 * timestamps authored relative to each other, not to the seed run's own {@code referenceNow}. This
 * writer never uses those timestamps directly - it computes the span from the case's first event to
 * its last, asks {@link SeedTimeline#moderationCaseStart(Duration)} for a translated start instant,
 * then re-applies each event's own offset from the first event on top of that start. A pure
 * translation preserves the original relative order exactly, which is what makes "an {@code
 * admin_actions} row is never earlier than the report that triggered it" hold by construction:
 * every case's {@code report_submitted} events precede its {@code admin_action} events in the
 * source JSON, so they still do after translation. The {@code supplementary_actions} and {@code
 * supplementary_reports} arrays are combined into one shared pseudo-case timeline the same way, per
 * {@link SeedTimeline#moderationCaseStart}'s own Javadoc.
 *
 * <p><b>The one active-suspension case</b>: {@code case_01_spam_escalation}'s outcome is that
 * {@code user_suspended}'s 7-day suspension is still active as of {@code referenceNow} - this is
 * the one case whose start cannot be picked by {@link SeedTimeline#moderationCaseStart}, since that
 * method only guarantees every translated instant lands in the past. It uses {@link
 * SeedTimeline#moderationCaseStartWithActiveAnchor} instead, anchored on the case's {@code
 * suspend_user} event, which is what makes the suspension's expiry land strictly after {@code
 * referenceNow} by construction. No other case or supplementary action carries an outcome that
 * depends on the seed run's "now", so this is the only special case.
 *
 * <p><b>Synthetic targets</b>: {@code moderation_cases.json} references three kinds of target that
 * do not exist as literal rows anywhere else in the seed content - {@code target_story_ref} (a
 * narrative id resolved to "any story this username owns", guaranteed non-empty by {@link
 * StorySeedWriter}'s reserved story-owner slots), {@code target_comment_ref} (a {@code
 * postSeedId#label} pair resolved by creating a real comment on that post the first time any event
 * references it, memoized by ref for every later event that reuses it), and {@code
 * target_conversation_id} + {@code target_message_index} (resolved back to a real conversation via
 * {@link MessageSeedWriter#directPairKey}, then indexed into that conversation's messages ordered
 * by {@code created_at} - an order {@link SeedTimeline#messageCreatedAt} guarantees matches the
 * scripted array order). Migration V79 added {@code admin_action_type}'s 27th value, {@code
 * revoke_session}, which is exactly what five {@code supplementary_actions} entries use; this
 * writer records those the same as every other {@code admin_action}, with no further side-effect
 * table write, since no seeded table tracks individual live sessions.
 *
 * <p><b>Background reports</b>: the 6 cases' {@code report_submitted} events plus {@code
 * supplementary_reports} total only ~40 rows, well short of this writer's ~180 target, and the
 * narrative content alone never exercises {@code report_type = 'user'} at all and leaves {@code
 * 'story'}/{@code 'message'} at zero and {@code 'comment'} short of {@link
 * com.app.common.seed.SeedRunner}'s per-value floor - a plausible report queue needs more
 * day-to-day noise than six narrative cases script anyway. The remainder is filled by {@link
 * #writeBackgroundReports}, drawing a report type from a weighted list ({@code
 * BACKGROUND_REPORT_TYPES}, {@code post}-heavy but every other declared value represented) and a
 * random target of that type never owned by the drawing reporter (matching {@code
 * report/DATA_RULES.md}'s self-report rule) with a fixed-seed {@link Random} independent of {@link
 * SeedTimeline}'s own stream, timestamped via {@link SeedTimeline#likeOrSaveCreatedAt} off the
 * target's own {@code created_at} the same way a like or a save is. Every report this writer
 * inserts - narrative, supplementary or background - is tracked in one {@code (reporter, type,
 * entity)} key set so a background draw can never collide with {@code
 * uq_reports_reporter_type_entity} (V30).
 *
 * <p><b>Row-at-a-time inserts</b>: unlike every other writer in this package, this one does not
 * build one {@code List<Object[]>} per table and batch it at the end. A warning references the
 * {@code admin_actions} row that explains it, a strike references the same, and a report's
 * resolution can only be written once the report itself has an id - every row here depends on an id
 * minted by a row inserted moments earlier in the same case, so the two-phase batch pattern {@link
 * MessageSeedWriter} uses does not fit. Row counts are small enough (low hundreds total) that
 * per-row {@code jdbc.update} calls cost nothing observable.
