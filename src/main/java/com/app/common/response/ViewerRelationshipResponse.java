/**
 * The requesting viewer's relationship to another user, embedded wherever a response renders a
 * follow or block control for that user.
 *
 * <p>All five fields are always present and never null; an anonymous viewer or a self-reference
 * resolves to every field {@code false} rather than the field being omitted, so a client never has
 * to branch on presence. {@code isFollowing} and {@code isFollowRequested} are mutually exclusive:
 * the {@code follows} row for a pair is either {@code accepted} or {@code pending}, never both.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately carries no "this user has blocked the viewer" field. The application implements a
 * stealth block model: a blocked viewer must be unable to distinguish "this account does not exist"
 * from "this account has blocked me" on any surface, and a boolean confirming the latter is exactly
 * the disclosure that model forbids. Every list this record is embedded in must also exclude an
 * account that has blocked the viewer from the result set entirely, rather than including it with
 * this flag set - the row must not appear, not merely be flagged.
