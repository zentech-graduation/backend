/**
 * Every metric {@code platform_stats} carries, with the statement that computes it.
 *
 * <p>Each statement selects exactly two columns, a dimension and a value, so one insert template
 * serves all of them. A metric with no breakdown selects the empty string as its dimension. {@code
 * GROUP BY} produces no row for an empty group, so a dimension nobody holds in a bucket has no row
 * rather than a row holding zero, and every reader treats a missing dimension as zero.
 *
 * <p>The distinction between the two kinds is the whole design and is not a detail of presentation.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Kind#GAUGE} is the state of the world at the end of the bucket. Its statement takes
 * one bind, the bucket end, and bounds the population by it. Bounding by the bucket end rather than
 * counting whatever exists when the job happens to run is what lets the job be re-run for a past
 * bucket without overwriting that bucket's history with today's numbers.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Kind#FLOW} is how much happened inside the bucket. Its statement takes two binds, the
 * bucket start and end, and counts rows created between them. Flows are never derived by
 * subtracting consecutive gauges: a deletion would make the difference negative, and a missed run
 * would fold two intervals into one bucket undetectably.
 *
 * <p>Gauges apply each table's liveness filter and flows do not, which is deliberate rather than an
 * inconsistency. A post removed by moderation stops counting towards "posts on the platform" and
 * never stops counting towards "posts created in that half hour", because the second is a record of
 * something that happened.
