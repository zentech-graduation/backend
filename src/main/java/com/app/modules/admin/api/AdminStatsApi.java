/**
 * OpenAPI contract for the administrative statistics surface.
 *
 * <p>Both operations read stored aggregates. Nothing here counts a whole table at request time: at
 * production size a single {@code COUNT(*)} over accounts is seconds of work, and posts and
 * comments are larger again. A background job absorbs that cost every half hour, where seconds do
 * not matter, and the snapshot carries the time it was computed so a client can show staleness
 * rather than imply the numbers are live.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of metric are stored and they aggregate differently. Gauges are absolute snapshots
 * bounded by the end of their bucket; flows are direct counts of what happened inside the bucket. A
 * flow is never derived by subtracting consecutive gauges, so a moderation sweep cannot make "posts
 * created" read as a negative number.
 *
 * <p>Collection starts at the first bucket the process observed from its beginning, and there is no
 * backfill. A window reaching back before the deployment returns nothing for that stretch rather
 * than zeros.
