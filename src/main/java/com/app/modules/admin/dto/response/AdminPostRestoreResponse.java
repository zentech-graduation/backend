/**
 * Outcome of restoring a post that moderation had removed.
 *
 * <p>Restore is the one write path that strips a banned hashtag instead of refusing, because a
 * moderator correcting its own removal must not be blocked by an unrelated administrator decision.
 * The post therefore comes back carrying fewer tags than its caption names, and the moderator has
 * to be told: the audit row records it, but a moderator reads a response, not an audit row.
 *
 * <p>Wraps the audit event rather than adding a field to it. The audit event describes what was
 * recorded; these names describe what else happened to the post, which is not the same thing and
 * does not apply to the fourteen other actions that share that shape.
 *
 * <p>The list is the post's present state, not the delta of one action. It names every banned tag
 * the caption still carries after this restore, so repeating a restore names the same tags again.
 * That is deliberate: a reviewer wants to know what the post is missing now, and a delta would be
 * empty on the second restore while the caption still named a tag the post does not carry.
 *
 * @param action the immutable audit event written for this restore
 * @param remainingBannedHashtags normalized names the caption still carries that are not associated
 *     with the post because an administrator has banned them; empty when the caption names no
 *     banned tag, which is the normal case and also every restore whose result is not published
