/**
 * One post as an investigating moderator sees it.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not the public {@code PostResponse}. That carries viewer state, which is
 * meaningless here for the same reason it is on the report target: whether the reviewing moderator
 * has liked or saved the content is not part of the decision, and computing it would imply the
 * moderator is a viewer of the content in the ordinary sense.
 *
 * @param id post identifier
 * @param userId the author
 * @param username the author's username, or null once that account is deleted
 * @param status the post's lifecycle status, including {@code removed}
 * @param caption the caption, or null when the post carries none
 * @param removed whether the post is soft-deleted, so a moderator does not act twice
 * @param likeCount trigger-maintained like count
 * @param commentCount trigger-maintained comment count
 * @param createdAt when the post was created
