/**
 * Every actor-and-target rule for an administrative action against an account, in one place.
 *
 * <p>The endpoint annotations and path matchers are the first gate; this is the second. A service
 * method reachable from a consumer, a scheduled job, or another service must not depend on a caller
 * having passed through the controller.
 *
 * <p>Status changes and role changes share the same first three rules: only an administrator may
 * act, nobody may act on their own account, and an administrator is never a valid target. They were
 * written separately and drifting apart was a matter of time, since a rule added to one place would
 * not have been visible from the other. They are evaluated once here and each caller maps the
 * outcome to the error code its own contract publishes.
 *
 * <p>An administrator being an invalid target makes removing a rogue administrator deliberately a
 * database-level operation. An in-application route to lock out the whole administrator tier has no
 * recovery path, because a banned account cannot authenticate to undo it; a database escalation
 * does have one.
