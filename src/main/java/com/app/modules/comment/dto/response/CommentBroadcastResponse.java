/**
 * Broadcast projection of a comment: every {@link CommentResponse} field except {@code isLiked},
 * {@code hasReported}, and {@code pinned}.
 *
 * <p>One serialised blob is shared by every subscriber of a post's live comment stream, so a
 * viewer-dependent field cannot be resolved for it - the field is omitted entirely rather than
 * carrying a constant placeholder value, so a client reading a socket frame sees the key absent
 * instead of a value that looks correct but is not. {@code isLiked} and {@code hasReported} are
 * only ever correct on a {@link CommentResponse} returned over REST.
 *
 * <p>{@code pinned} is omitted for a different reason: it describes a comment's position on a
 * requested page, not the comment itself, and a broadcast frame belongs to no page.
