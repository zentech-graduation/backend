/**
 * The single writer to {@code user_events}.
 *
 * <p>Three event types are recorded, chosen for investigative value per unit of write volume: a
 * session start on successful login, a search, and a view of somebody else's profile. Every other
 * value of the {@code event_type} enum exists in the schema and is deliberately not produced;
 * {@code post_view} in particular is an order of magnitude higher in volume than all three combined
 * and belongs to a later cycle. A fourth type is added by calling {@link #record} with it, not by
 * adding a fourth insert.
 *
 * <p>Three properties this component guarantees, in the order they matter.
 *
 * <p>It never fails the caller's request. Analytics that can 500 a login are strictly worse than no
 * analytics at all, so every failure path here ends in a warn log and a dropped row. There is no
 * retry, no outbox and no dead letter: {@code OutboxService} exists for events that must reach
 * RabbitMQ, and these are not those.
 *
 * <p>It never extends the caller's transaction. The insert runs on a virtual thread of its own, so
 * it takes its own connection and commits on its own; a caller inside a transaction that later
 * rolls back still leaves the event recorded, which is correct, because the thing being recorded is
 * that a request happened and not that it succeeded.
 *
 * <p>It never becomes the reason the database runs out of connections. Submission is bounded by a
 * permit count well under the Hikari pool size, and a submission with no permit free is dropped
 * immediately rather than queued or blocked. Backpressure onto a request thread would defeat the
 * first property.
