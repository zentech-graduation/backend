     * Recomputes affinity for every user with activity in the window, in one statement.
     *
     * <p>Every read of {@code user_events} here is bounded by {@code created_at} on both sides.
     * That table is partitioned by month with a {@code DEFAULT} catch-all, so a predicate on {@code
     * user_id} alone prunes nothing and touches every partition ever declared; the bound is what
     * makes this a scan of the two or three partitions the window covers instead of all
     * twenty-four.
     *
     * <p>Event types are weighted by intent rather than counted equally, and each contribution
     * decays exponentially toward the end of the window so recent activity outranks old activity. A
     * reversal cancels its own action exactly - {@code post_unsave} carries the negation of {@code
     * post_save}, {@code post_unlike} of {@code post_like} - so a user who liked and then unliked a
     * post contributes nothing from that pair. A hashtag whose contributions sum to zero or below
     * is dropped rather than stored at zero.
     *
     * <p>{@code hashtag_click} is unioned in separately because its {@code entity_id} is already a
     * hashtag: it needs no join through {@code post_hashtags} and is the most direct statement of
     * interest available.
     *
     * <p>Banned and deleted hashtags are excluded here, at write time, not merely filtered on read.
     * A suggestion surface that offered one would produce a caption the post write path then
     * refuses with {@code POST_BANNED_HASHTAG}.
     *
     * <p>Scores are normalised into each user's own share of their decayed total, which is what
     * makes a user with three thousand events comparable with one with thirty; without it the
     * ranking would measure activity volume rather than interest.
     *
     * <p>{@code ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE} against the composite key is what keeps a double run
     * harmless rather than duplicative, following {@code platform_stats}. This system assumes a
     * single application instance and has no distributed scheduler lock.
     *
     * @param windowStart inclusive lower bound on {@code user_events.created_at}
     * @param windowEnd exclusive upper bound, and the point decay is measured back from
     * @param halfLifeSeconds age at which a contribution is worth half its original weight
     * @param computedAt stamp written on every row this run touches; the sweep uses it to find rows
     *     this run did not refresh
     * @return number of affinity rows inserted or updated
