 * only its SHA-256 hex stored in Redis, a forward key and a reverse key, issue made atomic by Lua
 * so a new token invalidates the previous one, and consumption made atomic by a Lua GET-then-DEL so
 * a token cannot be redeemed twice.
 *
 * <p>Consuming an appeal token does <strong>not</strong> mint a session. It authorises exactly one
 * action: creating one ticket against one audit row. {@code AuthServiceImpl.verifyEmail} is the
 * counter-example in this codebase - it consumes a token and calls {@code issueSession} with no
 * account-state check, which mints tokens for a banned account that are then refused on first use -
 * and this path deliberately does not repeat that shape.
