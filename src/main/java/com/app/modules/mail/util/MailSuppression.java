/**
 * The single place that decides whether a send failed or was deliberately never attempted.
 *
 * <p>{@code AbstractTemplateMailSender.dispatch} refuses a recipient outside the configured
 * allowlist by throwing {@code MAIL_RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED}. That is an operator's configuration
 * decision, not a delivery failure, and every lane that reaches a transport has to tell the two
 * apart the same way. Before this existed each lane answered differently: the moderation lane
 * recorded {@code SKIPPED}, the auth lane dead-lettered, and the campaign job recorded {@code
 * FAILED} - so on any developer machine, where the dev allowlist is {@code example.invalid}, the
 * dead-letter queue filled with decisions the operator had already made and campaign outcomes
 * reported failures that never happened.
 *
 * <p>The classification travels as a distinct error code, so this is routing rather than detection.
 * Walks the cause chain because a lane may wrap the original before it gets here.
