-- Separate from V93 because these INSERTs name the new enum values, which PostgreSQL does not make
-- usable until the ALTER TYPE transaction has committed. This is the same split V60/V61,
-- V54/V55, V75/V76 and V79/V80 all use.

-- requires_reason is TRUE for all three ticket actions. Every one of them is a decision communicated
-- to a person, and the reason column is what a later reviewer reads to understand it. is_reversible
-- is FALSE for all three: a response has been mailed and cannot be unsent, and reopening a ticket is
-- not modelled - the user opens a new one.
