"""Rewrites a ``pg_dump --schema-only`` file into the shape ``database/schema.sql`` uses.

The dump is authoritative for what the schema *is*; the existing file is authoritative for how
that schema is *presented* and for the commentary attached to it.  This script keeps both: it
reads every object out of the dump, and it lifts the comments out of the previous
``database/schema.sql`` and re-attaches them to whichever table or column still exists.

What it changes about the dump:

- drops the ``public.`` qualifier, the psql meta-commands and the ``SET`` preamble
- restores the short type spellings the file uses (``VARCHAR``, ``TIMESTAMPTZ``, ``UUID``)
- folds ``ALTER TABLE ONLY ... ADD CONSTRAINT`` back into the table body
- aligns column name, type and modifiers into the three columns the file has always used
- groups tables under the module banners the file has always used
- drops ``flyway_schema_history`` and the dated ``user_events_YYYY_MM`` partitions, because
  neither is schema a reader should treat as declared: one is Flyway's bookkeeping and the
  others are created at runtime by ``UserEventsPartitionJob``
