#
# Seeds a local development database with a small, fixed set of accounts and content.
#
# WHAT IT CREATES
#
#   Five accounts, all with the password SeedPass123! and all pre-verified:
#
#     seed_alice  alice@seed.local  role user       public account, two posts
#     seed_bob    bob@seed.local    role user       private account
#     seed_carol  carol@seed.local  role user       public account, one post
#     seed_mod    mod@seed.local    role moderator  moderation surfaces
#     seed_admin  admin@seed.local  role admin      admin surfaces
#
#   A follow graph: carol and alice follow each other (accepted), and alice has a
#   pending follow request against bob, who is private.
#
#   Three published text posts.
#
#   Denormalised counters (follower_count, following_count, post_count) are left to the
#   database triggers, per the project rule that application code never writes them.
#
# WHAT IT ASSUMES
#
#   - Run from anywhere; the script resolves the repository root from its own location.
#   - A .env at the repository root supplying POSTGRES_URL, POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_DB.
#   - The compose stack is up and Flyway has migrated the schema, which happens when the
#     application starts. The script refuses to run against an unmigrated database.
#   - The docker CLI is on PATH. No psql binary and no Python are needed on the host.
#
# WHY DIRECT SQL RATHER THAN THE HTTP API
#
#   The API route does work end to end: registration delivers a verification link to the local
#   Mailpit sink, and following it verifies the account. It is rejected here for two reasons
#   that have nothing to do with whether it works.
#
#   It needs the application, RabbitMQ and Mailpit all up and healthy before a single account
#   exists, which makes seeding fail for reasons unrelated to seeding. This script needs only
#   the compose PostgreSQL service, which has to be up regardless.
#
#   It also cannot be made idempotent. Re-registering an address is a conflict, not a no-op,
#   so a second run would either error or need to interpret the conflict as success, and the
#   second of those hides a genuine failure.
#
#   pgcrypto is enabled by migration V01, so crypt(..., gen_salt('bf', 12)) produces a BCrypt
#   hash that the application's BCryptPasswordEncoder(12) verifies natively.
#
# IDEMPOTENCY
#
#   Safe to run repeatedly. Every write is guarded by a natural key, so a second run inserts
#   nothing and reports zero rows affected. It never updates or deletes existing rows.
#
# RESET (--reset), off by default
#
#   Clears the content tables so a run starts from a known state, and returns the seeded accounts
#   to 'active' so a ban left behind by an earlier test does not block the next login.
#
#   This is opt-in precisely because it breaks the idempotency property above: it deletes rows this
#   script did not create. Leaving it off by default keeps the plain invocation safe to run against
#   a database somebody is working in, while giving end-to-end scripts one place to reset from
#   instead of each carrying its own block that drifts as tables are added.
#
#   Cleared: user_events, platform_stats, user_strikes, user_warnings, notifications, reports,
#   admin_actions, post_hashtags, hashtag_trending, hashtags, post_edit_history, posts,
#   outbox_events, processed_messages. Accounts, credentials and the follow graph are left alone,
#   since the seed recreates them idempotently anyway and deleting an account would cascade far
#   wider than a reset should reach.
#
# SAFETY
#
#   Refuses to run unless POSTGRES_URL points at localhost and the active Docker context is a
#   local socket. It cannot be pointed at a remote or production database. --reset is subject to
#   both guards, so it can only ever reach a disposable local database.
