"""Sources Pexels media for the seed dataset and uploads it to the R2 dev bucket.

Refuses to run against any R2 bucket other than the configured dev bucket name.
Idempotent: HEAD before PUT, skips assets already present.

Produces src/main/resources/seed/media/media_manifest.json with three top-level arrays:
images (120), videos (15), banners (25) - 160 objects total from a fresh provisioning run.
Avatars are sourced separately (a literal randomuser.me URL authored per user in users.json),
never uploaded to R2. (The checked-in manifest also carries 5 images reclassified from the
former avatar pool that real posts.json entries still reference - see media_manifest.json's
_reclassified_avatar_pool_note - which a fresh `provision` run does not reproduce; use
`--verify` against the existing manifest rather than re-running `provision` from scratch.)
Every physical asset is uploaded to R2 exactly once, under a stable
seed/library/{manifest_id}.{ext} key; downstream consumers (Task 5's
MediaSeedWriter) mint their own per-owner storage_key for each media_assets
row but reuse this manifest's single cdn_url, because storage_key is UNIQUE
in the database but the same physical file may back many owning rows.
